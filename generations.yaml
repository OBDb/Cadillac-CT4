    description: "The Cadillac CT4 is a compact luxury sedan that replaced the ATS in Cadillac's lineup. Built on GM's Alpha 2 platform with a rear-wheel drive layout (all-wheel drive optional), it features Cadillac's latest evolution of their Art & Science design language with distinctive vertical lighting elements, sharp creases, and a fastback-like profile. Standard powertrain options include a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder producing 237 HP in the Luxury and Premium Luxury trims, while the CT4-V sport model features a 2.7L turbocharged four-cylinder with 325 HP. The high-performance CT4-V Blackwing, introduced in 2022, is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.6L V6 delivering 472 HP, available with either a 6-speed manual or 10-speed automatic transmission. The interior offers a driver-focused cockpit with an 8-inch touchscreen, digital instrument options, and premium materials, though some critics noted its dimensions are slightly smaller than key competitors. Standard technology includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, while advanced driver assistance features are available through optional packages. The CT4 represents Cadillac's attempt to attract younger buyers to the brand with a vehicle that emphasizes driving dynamics in the competitive compact luxury sedan segment, continuing the sporting character of the ATS while updating its technology and design."
